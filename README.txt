1. Usage

The easiest and recommended way of using libmpatch in your project is simply
copying mpatch.h and mpatch.c into your project's source code.

An example program can be found in the example folder. It is heavily commented
to demonstrate and explain libmpatch's features and real-world usage.

The CMake configuration is only included for testing if the library compiles
and for the example program.

2. Documentation

Documentation can be built with Doxygen. A Doxyfile is included in the
repository; simply running Doxygen should be sufficient to build the docs.
